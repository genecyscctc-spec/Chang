# 💖 Happy Valentine’s Day, Roselle Joy 🌹

Hi love,

I made this little page just for you — not because I’m a web developer,
but because I wanted to do something simple, fun, and made with effort.

Every heart, rose, and silly “No” button here is meant to make you smile.
And if you clicked “Yes”… well, that made my day already. 😊

Thank you for being you.
Thank you for choosing me.
And thank you for making life warmer, happier, and better.

Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️  
— From Gelo Boy 🌹
